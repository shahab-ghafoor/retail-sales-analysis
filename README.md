# Retail Sales Analysis

**A comprehensive analysis of digitized sales data for an independent retail store.**


## 📖 Background

An elderly couple operating a brick‑and‑mortar retail store in Swat, Pakistan, maintained paper records of every transaction. To optimize inventory management, identify best-selling products, and gain a better understanding of customer spending patterns, these records were digitized and analyzed using Python and the pandas library.


## 🚀 Objectives

1. **Import & preprocess** the raw CSV sales data into a pandas DataFrame.  
2. **Explore the dataset** to understand data types, detect outliers, and inspect top transactions.  
3. **Aggregate & summarize** sales by product and by invoice to identify high‑value purchases and customer spending behavior.  
4. **Generate descriptive statistics** on invoice totals and investigate the relationship between units sold and revenue.  
5. **Provide actionable insights** and recommendations to the store owners.

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Highest single‑line sale:** A vintage kitchen cabinet sold for $ 295.00 in one invoice.  
- **Top‑selling product by frequency:** “HAND WARMER BIRD DESIGN” appeared on 8 invoices, with 14 units sold in total.  
- **Customer spending behavior (invoices 21–60):**  
  - Mean invoice total: $ 52.55  
  - Maximum invoice total: $ 295.00  
  - Total revenue: $ 2,102.03

### 🔍 Recommendations

1. **Stock up** on hand warmers and 3‑tier cake tins—top revenue generators.  
2. **Bundle promotions** around frequently co‑purchased items (e.g., hand warmers + seasonal décor).  
3. **Monitor low‑cost items** for volume trends to decide whether to expand or phase out offerings.
